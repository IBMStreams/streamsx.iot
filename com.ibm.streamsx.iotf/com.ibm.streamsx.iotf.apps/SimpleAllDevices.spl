 * Simple application that subscribes to
 * all events for all devices for an organization.
 * 
 * This application is very simple in that it
 * just produces streams of device events from the
 * organization. The data may be viewed
 * using IBM Streams views in Streams Studio
 * or Streams console. This is intended as a way
 * to verify connectivity between IoTF and Streams
 * and explore the events and commands the devices
 * are producing and consuming
 * 
 * Additional functionality may be added in the future.
 * 
 * These submission time parameters must be defined:
 * * `orgId` - IoTF Organization identifier
 * * `apiKey` - IoTF API key
 * * `apiToken` - IoTF API Token
