 * Integeration with Apache Edgent.
 *
 * *Note: Apache Edgent is undergoing a rename so links 
 * on this page may be broken during the transition.*
 * 
 * # Apache Edgent
 * [http://edgent.apache.org|Apache Edgent] is a programming model and runtime that can be embedded in gateways and devices. An open source solution for implementing and deploying edge analytics on varied data streams and devices.
 *
 * Edgent interacts with IBM Streams through IBM Watson IoT Platform.  Edgent locally separates the interesting from the mundane, so you donâ€™t have to send every sensor reading over a network. If 99% of readings are normal, Edgent detects the 1% anomalies and just sends those as device events for further analysis with IBM Streams.
* 
* IBM Streams applications analyze device events from Edgent applications and then can control individual devices by sending device commands based upon the analytics.
 *
 * # Apache Edgent IBM Watson IoT Platform connector
 * Edgent provides a connector to IBM Watson IoT Platform to allow
 * easy submission of device events and reception of device commands.
 * 
 * Its API is described here: [http://edgent.apache.org/javadoc/latest/index.html?org/apache/edgent/connectors/iotf/IotfDevice.html|org.apache.edgent.connectors.iotp.IotpDevice]

 *
 * A sample application is provided: [http://edgent.apache.org/javadoc/latest/index.html?org/apache/edgent/samples/connectors/iotp/IotpSensors.html|org.apache.edgent.samples.connectors.iotp.IotpSensors]
