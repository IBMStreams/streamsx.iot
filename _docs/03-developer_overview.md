In the new toolkit site layout the "Development" section will hold domain specific information for those who want to contribute to the toolkit.

This section can hold information about requirements, design, implementation and test. Those information can be hints, rules and guides.

Actually for the streamsx.iot toolkit there is only the ["User Documenation"]({{site.url}}/streamsx.iot/docs/user/overview/) available.
