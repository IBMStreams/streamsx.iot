In the new toolkit site layout the "Knowledge" section will hold domain specific information of the domain the toolkit is used in.

For the streamsx.iot toolkit this section can hold hints and additional information around basic knowledge how to use IBM Watson IoT platform.

Actually for the streamsx.iot toolkit there is only the ["User Documenation"]({{site.url}}/streamsx.iot/docs/user/overview/) available.
