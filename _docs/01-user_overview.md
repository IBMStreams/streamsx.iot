# Overview

["IBM Watson Iot Platform"](https://internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/) service provides a model around devices where devices produce events (for example, sensor data) and subscribe to commands (for example, control instructions, such as reduce maximum rpm for an engine).

IBM Streams applications can use this toolkit to connect to IBM Watson IoT Platform to provide real time analytics against all the events from potentially thousands of devices, including sending commands to specific devices based upon the analytics. 


# Documentation

There is SPLDOC as well as JAVADOC documentation available.

["com.ibm.streamsx.iot SPLDOC"]({{site.url}}/streamsx.iot/doc/spldoc/html/index.html)

# Samples
